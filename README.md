# IoT-Lora-Project
This project is meant to communicate with a cloud broker hosted in EMQX, store the temperature inputs of a Lora Sensor and plot a grapich to show how it varied along the day. It also shows a square that turns green or red depending on the value of the temperature to indicate if a heater is on or off.AA
