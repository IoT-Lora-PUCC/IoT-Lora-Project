# IoT-Lora-Project
This project is meant to communicate with a cloud broker hosted in EMQX, store the temperature inputs of a Lora Sensor and plot a grapich to show how it varied along the day. It also shows a square that turns green or red depending on the value of the temperature to indicate if a heater is on or off.
In order to run the programn, just use your python interpreter of choice (the version i am using is the 3.12.6 for 64bits) and make sure to install the libaries as tkinter, pandas and others. At last, you need to create an EMQX account and set the emqxsl-ca.crt file and the address in mqtt_client.py, if you'd like you can change the user and the password too or just keep the one already setted up. a
